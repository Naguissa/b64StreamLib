# Arduino IDE base64 (URL) stream library

## What is this repository for? ##

Base64 encoder/decoder that can act with whole strings or with byte-by-byte streams.


It's coded with base64 URL standard WITHOUT terminators. You can modify _charmap variable on cpp file to adapt your desired standard

B64STREAMLIB_indexDataType define controls capacity. Actually it uses unsigned char, so maximum buffer is 255 and maximum decoded variable is 191 chars long: mod(255 * 3 / 4)

EXTRA_YIELD() is a trick to not overload ESP8266 microcontrollers; in other boards it does nothing (skipped in compile-time).
